# Twitter-Clone Project
### [Project Site in BootCamp](https://flaviocopes.notion.site/BOOTCAMP-Week-9-92070824957a41e2911aec2846438a65#aec83603624b44a9b0329617d11b3539=)

## This is a simple clone of Twitter built using Prisma ORM, Next.js, TailWind CSS, Next-Auth with MailTrap and Railway/PostgresSQL.

It was built for learning purposes and for testing purposes.  It is mostly functional and will have updates added to it over time.

To Do: 
 - First try adding [colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color) if you want. Implement [dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) too, if you like.
- We currently don’t show the replies count in the tweets list. the only way to find out if a tweet has replies is to open the tweet. Fix this.
- Detect if a user does not exist when displaying the profile
- Add the ability to like tweets, and show the likes count.
- Add the “load more” button and pagionation like we did in the `/home` page to the user profile page too.
- Add the ability to remove your own replies to a tweet.
- If you’re not logged in, you don’t see the reply form when you visit a single tweet page.
- In the homepage tweets list for not-logged in guests, disable the links to the single tweet and user profile.
- Alternative: in the tweets list, also list the replies under the tweet. Perhaps just 2-3 and then a “see more replies” link.
